# HVAC-Air-Duct-Classification-by-ML-Models
This project uses machine learning to classify HVAC air duct systems as Sealed, Minor Leakage, or Major Leakage based on pressure loss and system efficiency. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest), evaluation, and visualization for performance insights.
